# Frontend Mentor - Weather app solution

This is my take on the [Weather app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/weather-app-K1FhddVm49). Spoiler alert: I may have gotten a little carried away with the unit conversion system. But hey, now you can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit faster than the weather changes in spring! üå¶Ô∏è

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown 
- Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Getting started

No build process, no npm install hell, no "it works on my machine" excuses. Just good old-fashioned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**To run it:**
- Double-click `index.html` like it's 2005 (and it'll work just fine!)
- Or if you're fancy: use VS Code Live Server or `npx serve`

**No API keys needed!** üéâ  
I'm using the completely free [Open-Meteo APIs](https://open-meteo.com/). Those folks are absolute legends for providing free weather data without making you sell your soul (or email) first.

## My process

### Built with

**The classics:**
- Semantic HTML5 (with ARIA roles because accessibility matters!)
- CSS custom properties, Flexbox, and Grid (the holy trinity)
- Mobile-first workflow (because let's be real, everyone checks the weather on their phone)

**Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks were harmed in the making of this app):
- Fetch API + AbortController (so your rapid typing doesn't crash the geocoding API)
- Geolocation API (for when you're too lazy to type your city name)
- localStorage (remembers your preferences like that one friend who remembers your coffee order)
- Intl.DateTimeFormat (because dates are hard and I'm not writing my own formatter)

**APIs:**
- Open-Meteo Geocoding API (finds your city)
- Open-Meteo Forecast API (tells you if you need an umbrella)

### What I learned

**The hard way:**
- If you keep converting temperature values back and forth between Celsius and Fahrenheit by reading them from the DOM, you'll end up with numbers that make absolutely no sense. Solution? Keep a "canonical state" in metric and convert on render. Mind = blown. ü§Ø

- `AbortController` is a lifesaver when users type faster than your API can respond. Without it, you get a beautiful race condition where "New York" shows weather for "New" instead. Ask me how I know.

- ARIA roles aren't just fancy attributes to make your HTML look smart. Turns out screen reader users actually need them! Who knew? (Everyone. Everyone knew. I learned this the hard way.)

- Weather codes from Open-Meteo are just numbers (like 0, 45, 95). Mapping those to actual icons? That's where the real detective work began. Pro tip: 95 = thunderstorm, not a sunny day. ‚õàÔ∏è

```js
// This tiny function saved me from so much pain:
function formatTemperatureC(valueC) {
  return units.temperature === 'fahrenheit' 
    ? celsiusToFahrenheit(valueC) + '¬∞' 
    : Math.round(valueC) + '¬∞';
}
```

### Continued development

**Things I'll probably add when I have time (read: never):**
- Full WAI-ARIA keyboard navigation that would make accessibility experts weep tears of joy
- Fancy loading skeletons instead of just showing "..." (I know, I know, it's basic)
- A full 24-hour hourly view because apparently 8 hours isn't enough for some people
- Precipitation and wind overlays (for the weather nerds out there)
- Maybe a "surprise me" button that shows weather for a random city? Because why not.

### Useful resources

**Lifesavers:**
- [Open-Meteo Docs](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) - Seriously well-documented API. No authentication BS. Just clean, free weather data. 10/10 would recommend.
- [MDN AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) - Taught me how to stop being a terrible person who floods APIs with requests.
- [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) - The bible for making custom components accessible. Heavy reading but worth it.
- [MDN Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) - Because I refuse to write another date formatter from scratch. Never again.

## Acknowledgments

Shoutout to [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for consistently providing challenges that make me question my life choices at 2 AM. 

Big thanks to the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) team for giving us free weather APIs without the usual "sign up for our enterprise plan" nonsense. You're the real MVPs.

And finally, thanks to coffee ‚òï for making this all possible.
